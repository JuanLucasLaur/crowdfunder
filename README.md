# Crowdfunder

Crowdfunding website written with React.js and Typescript, using smart contracts coded in Solidity. The site interacts with the contracts using web3.js .

## Installation

The project is written using next.js. After cloning it or downloading it you should install the project's dependencies using `npm install` . An Infura API link and key are also necessary â€” these should be exported from the `src/ethereum/config/~dev.js` file. The project can then be started using `npm run dev`.

### Other dependencies

This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting.

## Other scripts

There are other commands available besides `npm run dev`:

`npm run build`: Builds the application for production usage

`npm run start`: Starts a production server.

`npm run lint`: Runs ESLint for all files in the `src/pages` and `src/components` directories.

`npm run test`: Runs all tests in the `test` directory. The tests are written using mocha.
